  question: Pretend you are interested in determinging which turtles, sea turtles, box turtles, or snapping turtles, are better snow skiers.  Briefly outline a design for this study, making sure to include all principles of experimental design.
  answer: |
    \textbf{Replication}: we need to select multiple turtles from each type of turtle box, sea, and snapping; \textbf{Randomization}: randomly select multiple turtles as specified above; \textbf{Control}: we should ensure no individual turtle has an inherent advantage over the other turtles -- equal practice, same skis, same slopes, same day.

  question: |
    Consider the new statistic $\kappa = \frac{\bar{x}}{median} - 1$, which can be used as a measure of skewness.  Assume all the data of interest are positive, e.g.\ $x_i > 0$ for all $i$.  Identify the skewness for the following values of $\kappa$ and explain your reasoning.
  parts:
    - $\kappa < 0$
    - $\kappa > 0$
    - $\kappa = 0$
  answer:
    - right skewed
    - left skewed
    - symmetric

  question: |
    Consider the differences between the reading and writing scores of a random sample of $200$ students who took the High School and Beyond Survey.  The mean and standard deviation of the differences are $\bar{x}_{read-write} = 0.545$ and $s_{read-write}=8.887$ points.
  parts:
    - Is a paired t-test appropriate for these data?  Explain why or why not.
    - Calculate a $95$\% confidence interval for the average difference between the reading and writing scores of all students.
    - Interpret this interval in context.
    - Does the confidence interval provide convincing evidence that there is a real difference in the average scores? Explain.
  answer:
    - Yes, data are paired on student.
    - c(0.545 - qnorm(0.975)*8.887/sqrt(200), 0.545 + qnorm(0.975)*8.887/sqrt(200))
    - We are $95$\% that the true population meand difference of reading minus writing scores for High School and Beyond students is between c(0.545 - qnorm(0.975)*8.887/sqrt(200), 0.545 + qnorm(0.975)*8.887/sqrt(200))
    - The confidence interval does not provide convincing evidence of a true difference as the confidence interval contains 0.

  question: |
    Suppose a new graduate is considering a job in two locations, Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA, and she wants to see whether the average income in one of these cities is higher than the other.  She would like to conduct a hypothesis test based on the following summary statistics:
    \begin{table}[!h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lccc}
    city & $n$ & $\bar{X}$ & $s$ \\
    \hline
    Cleveland & $82$ & \$$35749$ & \$$39421$ \\
    Sacramento & $84$ & \$$35500$ & \$$41512$ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
  parts:
    - Set up and evaluate a hypothesis test at $\alpha = 0.05$.
    - Conclude and interpret in context the hypothesis test.
    - Would your test statistic be larger or smaller if the sample sizes increased?  Explain.
  answer:
    - |
      $H_0: \mu_C = \mu_S$ verse $H_1: \mu_C \ne \mu_S$ at $\alpha = 0.05$.
    - TODO
    - The test statistic would be larger if the sample size increased, since the standard error, in the denominator of the test statistic, would decrease.

  question: |
    Assume $X_1, \ldots, X_n \sim_{iid} Gamma(\alpha = 1, \beta)$, where $\beta$ is unkown.  The probability distribution function for $Gamma$ random variables is \[ f(x| \alpha, \beta) = \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha-1} \exp{(-\beta x)}. \]
  parts:
    - List the steps to find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for $\beta$.
    - Explain in words what the MLE is.
  answer:
    - Set up likelihood function, take natural log, take derivative with respect to unknown parameter, set derivative equal to zero, solve for unknown parameter.
    - The maximum likelihood estimator is the most likely value of the unknown parameter given the observed data.

  answer: |
    A few examples of appropriate answers.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item It's free, so I can use it outside of school.
    \item It is becoming more popular in my field as an statistical analytic tool.
    \item It's open source, so I could contribute my own packages for others to use.
    \item Because I plan on going to graduate school and doing research, and want to be able to conduct my own statistical analyses that are more complex than what Excel can handle.
    \item Because I want to make better graphics than what can be made in Excel.

  question: |
    Are there any outliers in this data set? Use the fences to decide. State the fences and if there are any outliers, identify them.
  answer: |
    The max data point \Sexpr{max(dog_age)} is below the upper fence of $Q_{3}+1.5*IQR = \Sexpr{q3.age+1.5*IQR(dog_age)}$, so there are no upper end outliers. The data point 45 is considered an outlier because it is below the lower fence of $Q_{1}-1.5*IQR = \Sexpr{q1.age-1.5*IQR(dog_age)}$.

    Possible answers include but are not limited to

    \item Most of the car data is between 30 and 40 MPG, most frequently around 32 or 33 MPG.
    \item The truck has a lower overall mpg, the bulk of the data between 20 and 30MPG, most frequently between 23-25.

  question: Which vehicle gets driven more? Justify your answer using two pieces of data.
  answer: |
    The car is driven much more often than the truck. Here are the two most clear ways this could be determined.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The frequency table generated by \R{table(fuelly\$model)} shows that the car has almost 3 times the total number of fuel-ups. This combined with the high average MPG on the car (as seen by \R{tapply(fuelly\$mpg, fuelly\$model, FUN=summary)}) indicate the car is driven more.
    \item The summary of the odometer value indicates that since the start of data tracking, the car has been driven around 50k miles whereas the truck only has had 17k miles put on it.

  answer: |
    They are not associated. If you were to draw a line down the middle of the data points for either of the two groups it is relatively horizontal. Furthermore doing a ``common sense" check indicates that the economic-driven price of gas at the pump cannot affect the inner workings of a vehicle to change the MPG the vehicle gets. \textcolor{red}{Points adjusted to 1, with +1EC for a common sense check.}

    Using the following histograms that display the heights of males and females, what can you say about the average height of males compared to females? Explain your reasoning. What does the height of the bars represent? Be specific.
    <<echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.align='center', fig.show='hold', out.width='.8\\textwidth', fig.pos='!h'>>=
    histogram(~Height|Sex, data=survey, layout=c(1,2), type="count", breaks=7)
    @
  answer: Most of the data for males is around 180cm, most frequently between 175 and 180cm. The bulk of the heights for females is around 165-170. I can make a reasonable guess that the average height for males is greater than the average height for females. The height of the histogram bars represent the frequency count of people measured in that range. For example, almost 30 males measured between 175 and 180 cm, and around 35 females measured around 165-170cm.

  answer: |
    The relevant R code needed to answer part a) and b) is \texttt{summary(los)} and \texttt{var(los)} \\
    The mean length of stay is \Sexpr{mean.los} days with a standard deviation of \Sexpr{sd.los} days. Responses range from \Sexpr{min(los)} to \Sexpr{max(los)}, with a median stay of \Sexpr{median(los)} days.

  answer: |
    Graded on: Correct answer (1), justification (1), grammer (1). The variance would decrease because a 5 is closer to the mean than a 55. The squared distance from the mean (the $\sum(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}$ portion of the variance calculation) for a data point of 55 is $(55-7)^{2}=2304$, compared to $(5-7)^2=4$.

  question: Are there any outliers in this data set? Use the fences to decide. State the fences and if there are any outliers, identify them.
  answer: The lower fence is $Q_{1}-1.5*IQR = \Sexpr{q1.los-1.5*IQR(los)}$ which is less than 0. There are no low end outliers. The upper fence is $Q_{3}+1.5*IQR = \Sexpr{q3.los+1.5*IQR(los)}$. Two data points, 26 and 55 are considered outliers because they are above the upper fence.

  question: What do the open dots on the boxplot represent? What makes these two points different from the rest of the data?
  answer: |
    Graded on: Correct answer (1), justification (1), grammer (1). The open dots on the boxplot are considered outliers. The upper fence is $Q_{3}+1.5*IQR = \Sexpr{q3.los+1.5*IQR(los)}$. Two data points, 26 and 55 are considered outliers because they are above the upper fence.

  question: Comment on the skewness of the data set.
  answer: The mean is greater than the median, and there are two high end outliers. The data is skewed to the right. The skew can also be detected by noting that the distance between $Q_{3}$ and the upper fence (18-12=6) is longer than the distance between the min and $Q_{1}$ (4-1=3).

  question: Describe the distribution of the fathers age. Use summary statistics, measures of center (location), shape and spread. Write your answer in narrative (paragraph) form as if you were writing a report.
  answer: |
    \textbf{Graded on:} Discussed location using mean or median (1), discussed spread using range, iqr, variance or sd (1), discussed shape (1), grammer(1). \\
    The average fathers age is \Sexpr{round(mean(fage),1)} with a standard deviation of \Sexpr{round(sqrt(var(fage)),1)} days. Responses range from \Sexpr{min(fage)} to \Sexpr{max(fage)}, with a median age of \Sexpr{median(fage)}. The ages are symmetric, with two potential high end outliers.

    \end{figure}
    }
  answer: The distribution of average weight gained during pregnancy is very similar between non-smoking and smoking mothers. Smoking mothers gain an average of 31.9lb and non-smoking mothers gain an average of 30.1 lbs. Smoking mothers have a higher standard deviation, 15.7 compared to 14.0 for non-smoking mothers, but non-smoking mothers have a higher max weight gained of 85 lbs compared to the max of 75 for smokers. The shape of the distribution of weight gained are approximtely normal for both groups, with a possible slight right skew. There are many more non smoking mothers compared to smoking mothers, this is demonstrated by the heights of the histogram bars.

  question: What does the area of the rectangles represent? Show an example.
  answer: The area of the rectangles is the cell proportions. For example 12\% of the students are right hand writing dominant but their left hand is on top when they clap their hands.
  id: mosiac_sample_prop
  author: robin
-
  question: Does it seem that these variables are independent? Justify your answer by using the marginal proportions and the standardized residual shadings.
  answer: There is likely a moderate relationship between the dominant writing and clapping hand. Almost all (97\%) of those who have a right hand dominant clap, also are right handed with writing. This combination is shaded light red, which corresponds to a moderately negative standardized residual score. This means the 3\% who are contrary is lower than expected if these variables were independent. Interestingly, there are more than expected lefties in the group who are left hand dominant for both activities. This is another indication that these variables are probably associated.

  question: |
    Rosiglitazone is the active ingredient in the controversial type~2 diabetes medicine Avandia and hasbeen linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as stroke, heart failure, and death. A common alternative treatment is pioglitazone, the active ingredient in a diabetes medicine called Actos. Data collected as part of a nationwide retrospective observational study of 227,571 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older are summarized in the contingency table below.
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ll  cc c}
    &   & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Cardiovascular problems}} \\

  question: How many patients on Pioglitazone had cardiovascular problems? How many patients on Rosiglitazone had problems? Can we conclude from these numbers that the rate of cardiovascular problems for those on a Pioglitazone treatment is higher.
  answer: 5,386 patients on pioglitazone had cardiovascular problems compared to 2,593 on Rosiglitazone. We cannot make this claim from these counts. Instead of comparing counts, we should compare percentages of people in each group who suffered cardiovascular problems.

  question: Do the data suggest that diabetic patients who are taking rosiglitazone are more likely to have cardiovascular problems than those on pioglitazone? Justify your answer.
  answer: Yes it does since the rate of incidence was (2,593 / 67,593 = 0.038) 3.8\% for patients on rosiglitazone, while it was only (5,386 / 159,978 = 0.034) 3.4\% for patients on pioglitazone.

    True or False: The fact that the rate of incidence is higher for the rosiglitazone group proves that rosiglitazone causes serious cardiovascular problems.
  answer: False. Association does not imply causation. We cannot infer a causal relationship based on an observational study. The difference between the two rates is subtle.

Even if there is evidence presented in the rest of the paper of a strong association between eating chocolate and weight loss, correlation or association does not imply causation. Furthermore, this evidence seems to contradict the general body of current scientific knowledge about chocolate and general health.
